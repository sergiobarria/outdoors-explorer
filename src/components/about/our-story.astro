					Outdoors Explorers was born from a simple idea: that exploring the world
					shouldn&apos;t come at the cost of damaging it. Founded by Emma Green in 2005,
					our company has grown from a small local tour operator to a global leader in
					sustainable tourism.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">
					We&apos;ve taken thousands of adventurers to the far corners of the Earth,
					always with a focus on minimizing our environmental footprint and maximizing
					positive impact on local communities.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Today, we continue to innovate in eco-friendly travel practices, setting new
					standards for responsible tourism and inspiring a new generation of conscious
					travelers.
