					Outdoors Explorers was born in 2010 from a shared passion for adventure and a
					deep respect for nature. Our founders, Alex and Sarah, met on a challenging trek
					in the Himalayas and realized their dream of creating a company that could bring
					the transformative power of outdoor adventures to people from all walks of life.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-400">
					Starting with just three local tours, we've grown to offer expeditions across
					six continents, always maintaining our commitment to sustainable travel and
					unforgettable experiences. Over the years, we've helped thousands of adventurers
					push their limits, discover new cultures, and forge lifelong connections with
					nature and fellow travelers.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-400">
					Today, Outdoors Explorers stands as a leader in the adventure travel industry,
					known for our expert guides, commitment to safety, and our ability to create
					journeys that challenge, inspire, and transform.
